      <p>
        My name is Pedro. I graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2013 with a degree in Medical Laboratory Sciences. 
        I discovered the beauty of web programming while in college and made my first website before graduating. At that point I 
        started to second guess my decision for the major I chose. I love clinical science and to this day still enjoy what I do, 
        but deep down I've always have had a passion for computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first website that I made was not exactly programming, more of a drag and drop "what you see is what you get" type of 
        setup made with <a href="http://muse.adobe.com">Adobe Muse</a>, but it's the experience that opened up my mind to the 
        possibilities. Soon after, I started to teach myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript. After months of online tutorials, and 
        endless google searches of how-tos I finally started to feel like I understood what was going on. I came across 
        <a href="https://jquery.com">JQuery</a>, and felt very comfortable from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
        With my new knowledge of JQuery I designed a mobile application using 
        <a href="https://jquerymobile.com">JQuery Mobile</a> and <a href="https://ludei.com/cocoonjs">CocoonJS</a> 
        called ClikWik. Using the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page">Wikipedia API</a>
        the mobile app is used to look up Wikipedia articles, parse the HTML then display the article as clickable fragments that 
        could be stored using the browsers <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">IndexedDB API</a>.
        The user interface was not perfect, but the experience taught me the process of uploading a mobile application to 
        the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Amazon App Store.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few months after uploading my first mobile application, I started to teach myself 
        <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>. Soon after I discovered <a href="http://ionicframework.com">Ionic</a> 
        and decided to re-write my mobile application. In the process I also discovered <a href="https://www.firebase.com">Firebase</a> 
        and decided to use this to store data over the web. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The second time around was a major improvement to my first attempt at making a mobile application, and 
        the experience opend my eyes to even more possibilities. With these new skills I built a web appilcation 
        for a relative's business, a prototype for a web-based POS system, and a prototype for a web-based time 
        tracking application.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal from all of this is to enter the field of professionsl web development. I am eager to learn new 
        skills and bring my own to a team.
