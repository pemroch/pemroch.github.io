      <p>
        My name is Pedro. I graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2013
        with a degree in Medical Laboratory Sciences. I discovered the beauty of web programming
        while in college and made my first website before graduating. At that point I started to 
        second guess my decision for the major I chose. I love science and to this day still enjoy 
        what I do, but deep down I've always have had a passion for computers and how they function.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first website that I made was not exactly programming, more of a drag and drop
        "what you see is what you get" type of setup made with Adobe Muse, but it's that experience
        that opened up my mind to the possibilities. Soon after, I started to teach myself HTML, CSS, 
        and Javascript. After a months of online tutorials, and endless google searches of how-tos I 
        finally started to feel like I actually understood what was going on. I came across JQuery, and
        felt very comfortable from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
        With my new knowledge of JQuery I designed a mobile application using JQuery mobile and CocoonJS 
        called ClikWik. Using the Wikipedia API the mobile app was used to look up Wikipedia articles, 
        parse the HTML then display the article as clickable fragments that could be stored using the 
        browsers IndexedDB API.The user interface was not perfect, but the experience taught me the 
        process of uploading a mobile application to both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few months after uploading my first mobile application, I started to teach myself AngularJS. Soon
        after I discovered IonicJS and decided to re-write my mobile application using Ionic. In the process I 
        also discovered Firebase and decided to use this to store data over the web.

        The second time around was a major improvement to my first attempt at making a mobile application, and 
        the experience opend my eyes to even more possibilities. With the skills I have learned over the past 
        2 years I
